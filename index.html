        <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to #minacoding !!</h2>
        <p class="section-text">Welcome to #minacoding!
        Let's make June a month where you can fully express your daily creativity and enjoy lots of creative coding!<br>
        The name #minacoding is a coined word combining "minazuki" meaning June in Japanese and "mina" meaning everyone!<br>
        I would be happy if this could be an opportunity to take a fresh look at the creative coding activities of various
        people globally, across many countries!</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What is #minacoding?</h2>
        <p class="section-text">#minacoding is a daily coding event with a daily theme of creative coding.<br>
        it has been running since 2022 and will be in its third year in 2024.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="when-event evebt-info">
        <h2 class="section-title">When is #minacoding?</h2>
        <p class="section-text"><a href="theme.html">Themes</a> are given and carried out over a one-month period from 1 June to 30 June.<br>
        However, there is no need to stick to this one month or order, and it is perfectly acceptable to work on the theme for
        17 days on 1 June, even if the work is done after July.<br>
        The important thing is that you, as you learn about the event, will be coding, so that a wide variety of work will come
        to the event and creative coders will be able to interact with each other.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">How to join #minacoding?</h2>
        <p class="section-text">The main feature of #minacoding is that it is very easy to participate.<br>
        You create a piece of work with your favourite programming tool, p5.js, processing, shader, unity, touch designer, etc.,
        based on the day's theme.<br>
        Then post your work on social networks such as X or instagram with the hashtag #minacoding.<br>
        This will help us to collect a lot of work on #minacoding.<br>
        Please search for #minacoding and react to other creations to make it more exciting!</p>
