        <p class="section-text">Welcome to #minacoding!
        Let's make June a month where you can fully express your daily creativity and enjoy lots of creative coding!<br>
        The name #minacoding is a coined word combining "minazuki" meaning June in Japanese and "mina" meaning everyone!<br>
        I would be happy if this could be an opportunity to take a fresh look at the creative coding activities of various
        people globally, across many countries!</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What is #minacoding?</h2>
        <p class="section-text">#minacoding is a coding event centered around a monthly creative coding theme. This event has been running 3 years
        strong since 2022.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="when-event evebt-info">
        <h2 class="section-title">When is #minacoding?</h2>
        <p class="section-text"><a href="theme.html">Themes</a> are given and carried out over a one-month period from June 1st to June 30th.<br>
        However, there is no need to stick to the set order. It is perfectly acceptable, for example, to work on June 17th's
        theme on June 1st. Also, there is no deadline for the completion of themes so feel free to work at a comfortable pace.<br>
        The important thing is that you, as you learn about the event, will be coding, so that a wide variety of work will come
        to the event and creative coders will be able to interact with each other.</p>
